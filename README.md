# IDBG (I debug)

`IDbg` is a debugging toolkit for Ruby and Ruby on Rails projects. It aims to increase the velocity and accuracy of a mid-level debugging workflow:
- isolated durable log stream
- various break conditions
- hit metrics and reactors
- call inspectors
- and more

It's a single file non intrusive (no need to commit) addition to any Ruby projects.
